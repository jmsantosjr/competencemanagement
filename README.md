# Competency Management System developed with People Analytics

This is de code developed during my MBA in Data Science at USP. 

Abstract:
The job market is changing rapidly and leading to a high obsolescence of the skills required to perform the job. Due to this situation, companies need to seek alternatives for management by competencies that are personalized and involve all their employees. In this scenario, a challenge is to create a system that can, through a well-defined process, guide strategies for developing competencies that are based on data. In this work, we propose a competency management system designed based on people analytics concepts. To exemplify the use of the system, we used real anonymized data from a QA team of a software development company. With these data, we explored various forms of visualization and applied descriptive, prescriptive and predictive statistical analyzes. From the analyzes carried out and the functionalities that the system provides, knowledge about the current and required competence status of employees is raised. With this knowledge, it is possible to create individual development plans based on data, not subjective analysis, for all employees.
